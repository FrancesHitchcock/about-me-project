            <p>Hi, my name's Frances and I live near Halesworth in North Suffolk. I am currently following the Tech Educators Full Stack Bootcamp course so I can learn to be a coder and start a new career. When I'm not coding I enjoy walking in the great outdoors, reading good novels and days out with family and friends.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Education</h2>
            <p>I don't have a mathematical background. I have a degree in English Language and Literature from Newcastle University, where I had the choice to do Computational Linguistics as one of my modules. I rejected that idea at the time, and I shouldn't have done. I went on to do a PGCE teaching certificate so I could become a teacher.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Previous Experience</h2>
            <p>I have around ten years' experience as a Primary School Teacher in various schools in Suffolk. After I left teaching I did various admin jobs including a stint of over ten years at Sizewell B Power Station. I have also had various jobs in retail and project co-ordinatorship.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">My Goals</h2>
            <p>I want to become a good coder and work for a great company that encourages its people to develop into an excellent coder. Then I would like to design web sites from scratch and see my projects through to delivery. Eventually I might work as a freelance developer.</p>
